# Hello, I'm Hazer!

Nice to meet you, curious adventurer.
My little den here is currently small but expanding each day as I learn new languages and dive deeper into the rabbit hole.

### What I'm up too

I'm currently working on an avatar site in my spare time from scratch using laravel.
This is a learning project for me to familiarize myself with laravel, plus I've always wanted to make one.
If you're not sure what an avatar site is, Gaiaonline is the best example.
Essentially it's a dress up doll site but with an economy with games and other methods of earning items to wear.
I've been addicted to these kinds of sites since a young age so what better way to improve my skillset by trying to make one?

### What I've done

At one point in time I created a fansite for Gaiaonline called Go Gaia (based off of their original name) where in had an advanced item search and filter system (compared to Gaia's) and the ability to create dynamic quest bars which would show progress towards earning items/currency for said items. This project included using PHP's Imagick Library (Imagemagick) to create the dynamic bars and creating scripts to spider through the site's market and other api's to create, fill and update the item database, as well as the main site which was coded in pure PHP without the use of a framework and Jquery for the front end.

After a while I joined the [Voltra Online](https://www.voltra.us) team as a developer and added a plethora of content onto the website such as website themes, a whole new inventory management and dress up system, outfits and much more. Some of my main contributions to voltra were upgrading the framework entirely to a newer version, adding caching throughout the entire site to speed up page loading times and swapping servers and infrastructure entirely. To add onto this I had refactored and fixed a lot of older features that had frustrated the users for quite a while (to name one would be the trading system). I am no longer part of the voltra team as I decided to move on and focus on other ventures such as my own and my friends projects.

Talking of my friends projects, I joined the [Lasria](https://www.lasria.com/) team shortly after, where I have created a couple of HTML5 canvas games in pure Javascript (hedgehog havoc & concentration) with no game frameworks as well as helped on some other projects such as character creation, bugfixes and security testing. These contributions were in the form of PHPBB 3 Extensions including ACP modules (for some of them). Due to life circumstances I have temporarily stopped working with Lasria to focus on my own projects and portfolio to seek full time employment.

That's the history, it's quite short but the horizon is opening up for more in the future, as I go to focus more on my own projects and dreams.    
If you want to keep track and follow me on my journey feel free to stalk this github or more importantly contact me (details below), as unfortunately a lot of the projects I've worked on and continue to work on are private therefore this profile looks pretty bare to the public eye.

### Familiar Languages/Libraries

These are the languages and libraries that I'm familiar with and/or in the middle of learning.

- HTML5 & CSS3
- Javascript & Canvas
- JQuery
- PHP
- Imagemagick
- Laravel
- CodeIgniter
- VueJS
- Vuex & Nuxt

I'm always looking to learn more and widen that field, so this list will most likely grow in the near future.
