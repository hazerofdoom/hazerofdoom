# Hello, I'm Hazer!

Nice to meet you, curious adventurer.
My little den here is currently small but expanding each day as I learn new languages and dive deeper into the rabbit hole.

### What I'm up too

I'm currently working on an avatar site in my spare time from scratch using laravel.
This is a learning project for me to familiarize myself with laravel, plus I've always wanted to make one.
If you're not sure what an avatar site is, Gaiaonline is the best example.
Essentially it's a dress up doll site but with an economy with games and other methods of earning items to wear.
I've been addicted to these kinds of sites since a young age so what better way to improve my skillset by trying to make one?

### Familiar Languages/Libraries

These are the languages and libraries that I'm familiar with and/or in the middle of learning.

- HTML5 & CSS3
- Javascript & Canvas
- JQuery
- PHP
- Imagemagick
- Laravel
- CodeIgniter
- VueJS
- Vuex & Nuxt

I'm always looking to learn more and widen that field, so this list will most likely grow in the near future.

I don't bite, only nibble gently.
Having more people to discuss my projects with and talk too in general about web design and development would be great, so feel free to hit me up.
